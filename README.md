# **Notes Web Application.**
## Simple notes manager

Link to page of the project: https://noteswebapp.pl

## Idea of the project 
This was my second full stack project in node.js. I don't want to copy existing in the Internet projects and decided to make my own version. It's not perfect in the graphic layer but work (in my opinion) perfectly.

## Functionality of application
This application allows users to make, save, delete and edit their own notes. Each user can register and store notes in their user profile. In addition app allows to save selected note to PDF file and set individual profile image. 

## Tech stack 

### Used technologies :

1. HTML, TailwindCSS, JavaScript.
2. Node.js with Express.js as a API/server.
3. Mysql database.
4. phpMyAdmin for database management.

## Summary
Making this project I felt more comfortable. I knew what I have to do, know the basic of Node.js and Express.js framework. Javascript also wasn't a problem. TailwindCSS was new to me, first minutes with this tool was difficult, but I think the project doesn't look too bad.
Ok, it have a few bugs and imperfections, but I can already say that I am planning to rebuild this app. I am learning SCSS and REACT and I will use this technologies to make version 2 of Notes Web Application.

## Installation

To use this project simply clone the repository. Also you can make some changes in the code (cors options and addresses to fetch data), create your own Dockerfile and use this app in the Docker container. Remember to delete node_modules folder before (sorry, my bad).
